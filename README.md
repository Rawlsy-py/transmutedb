# TransmuteDB

⚗️ **TransmuteDB** is a Python-first data platform framework for fast, composable, CLI-driven data pipelines built on [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/), [Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/), and Jinja2 templates.

It provides a Laravel-style development workflow for data engineers — scaffold flows and transformations with a single CLI command, run them with confidence, and scale from POC to production.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **CLI-first** design with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)
- ⚡ **Polars** for fast, type-safe data transformation
- 🧬 **Prefect OSS** orchestration for modern workflows
- 🧱 **Layered architecture**: bronze → silver → gold
- 📦 Scaffold pipelines in seconds with Jinja2 templates
- 🧪 Extensible test and validation model (Pandera-ready)
- 🗃️ Supports PostgreSQL (initial MVP), future support for DuckDB, Azure SQL, etc.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

Instead of using this repository directly, users should use the CLI to initialize a new TransmuteDB project. The structure below is what will be generated by running the `init` command:

```
your_project/
├── src/
│   ├── flows/            # Prefect flows
│   ├── tasks/            # Polars transformations
│   ├── sql/bronze/       # Raw ingest SQL
│   ├── config/           # Object metadata registry
│   └── tests/            # Pytest tests for pipelines
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## 🔧 Quickstart

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
python cli/main.py init my_new_project
cd my_new_project
```

### 2. Scaffold Data Pipeline Components

You can scaffold various components using the CLI:

- **Scaffold a flow:**

  ```bash
  python cli/main.py scaffold flow <name>
  ```

- **Scaffold a task:**

  ```bash
  python cli/main.py scaffold task <name>
  ```

- **Scaffold SQL ingest:**

  ```bash
  python cli/main.py scaffold sql <name>
  ```

- **Scaffold a config:**

  ```bash
  python cli/main.py scaffold config <name>
  ```

- **Scaffold a test:**

  ```bash
  python cli/main.py scaffold test <name>
  ```

### 3. Run a Flow

```bash
python src/flows/<your_flow>_flow.py
```
```

## 🧪 Testing (coming soon)

```bash
pytest
```

## 🧠 Design Principles

- ✅ Convention over configuration
- ✅ Reproducible from the CLI
- ✅ Type-safe transformations
- ✅ Observable by default
- ✅ Developer-first DX
